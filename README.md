# Code-Quiz

## Description

This project and website itself is a quizzing test site. The reason for this website is for any fullstack user that wants to test themselves and take a brief test over random questions pertaining to coding in general. This project was created with the beginning foundations of HTML,CSS, and Javascript but includes many tools inside each of their structures.

- My motivation for this project was that I wanted to test my knowledge and understanding of web Api's that were extended and built upon my previous knowledge of everything learned in the course during the previous weeks.
  
- The reason for building this project was that I wanted to create a website for any coding user to visit and take a quiz on their coding knowledge. This site and quiz in particular can be taken by anyone as it is a brief quiz and in itself acts a game to play.
- 
- The problem that this coding quiz solves is that it provides the user a place to go and test themselves with a short quiz over different topics of code, wether or not their use for it is just for casual fun or to use for a specific scenario pertaining to their needs.

- Working on this project I learned how to take the skills that I currently learned and apply them to my previous knowledge so that it can build onto it cohesively.
